Two users: admin and asd

User1:  
username: admin  
password: admin

User2:  
username: asd  
password: asd

When logging in as admin, go to path /profile/asd, you will see a login count and login attempt for that user and button "login as" which only admin can see.
Clicking on "login as" will log in as that user.
